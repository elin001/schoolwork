# schoolwork
This is my markdown for my schoolwork repo. My name is Ellie, and I'm a junior Journalism major at the University of Missouri. Here's my [website](wwww.ellie-lin.com)
I'm editing this markdown file for INFOTC1600. I took INFOTC1600 for my certificate in media technology and design. So far, I've enjoyed learning about: 
1. File types
2. OSI 
3. The internet
I've done a bit of code before, and have used markdown files in RStudio. I have never used github to edit a markdown file though. *You learn something new every day*
