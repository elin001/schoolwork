Tutorial: 5G

Tutotorial is by Ellie Lin

This tutorial will serve as an introduction fo 5G, providing a basic overview, history and a sample of what technologies could be impacted. 

Target audience: People who have never been exposed to 5G beyond a commercial

**What is 5G?**
5G is the latest generation in a series of mobile networks. The International Telecommunications Union, which is the United Nation’s agency on communication technology, set the standard for 5G in 2015. Standards include a lessened latency and faster download speeds than previous networks – eventually up to 10 gigabits per second. [Edwards, Hoffman](https://www.howtogeek.com/340002/what-is-5g-and-how-fast-will-it-be/). 5G will also include the capability for more devices to connect to a network. Networks began rollouts in 2018 and are still being implemented worldwide [Duffy](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/03/business/what-is-5g/). 

**History of The Gs - From [Ovation Wireless](https://www.ovationwireless.com/how-wireless-technology-went-from-1g-to-5g-in-five-decades/#:~:text=1G%20Launched%20by%20Nippon%20Telegraph,to%20have%201G%20service%20nationwide).**
Mobile networks began with the first generation. 1G was introduced by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone in 1979 in Tokyo, Japan. It did not initially have any data capabilities. 2G was introduced in Finland in 1991. It introduced digital signaling in radio networks, 2G improved sound quality and maxed out at a download speed of 0.2mbps. 3G ultimately changed the way that the wireless industry operated. “The main aim of 3G was to support high-speed data, and the original 3G technology allowed data-rates up to 14Mbps. With its ability to transmit greater amounts of data at higher speeds, 3G enabled users to make video calls, surf the web, share files, play online games, and even watch TV online.” 3G will be mostly retired by the end of 2022. 4G, which is still used widely today, “4G was the first generation to use LTE technology to deliver theoretical download speeds of between 10Mbps and 1Gbps, offering end users better latency (less buffering), improved voice quality, instant messaging services and social media.” 

**The Capabilities**
Part of the excitement around 5G is because it ushers in enormous technological and economic possibilities. Here are just a few of the potential technologies 5G could impact:
